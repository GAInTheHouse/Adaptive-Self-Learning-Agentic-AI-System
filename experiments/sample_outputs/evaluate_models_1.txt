TASK 1: Model Evaluation
==================================================

🔍 Comparing Whisper vs Wav2Vec2...

🔍 Loading models...
Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForCTC were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h and are newly initialized: ['wav2vec2.masked_spec_embed']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

📊 Benchmarking on 1 samples...
Using custom `forced_decoder_ids` from the (generation) config. This is deprecated in favor of the `task` and `language` flags/config options.
Transcription using a multilingual Whisper will default to language detection followed by transcription instead of translation to English. This might be a breaking change for your use case. If you want to instead always translate your audio to English, make sure to pass `language='en'`. See https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/28687 for more details.
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
