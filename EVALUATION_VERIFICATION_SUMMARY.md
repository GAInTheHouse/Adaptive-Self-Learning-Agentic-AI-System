## 📊 NUMBERS THAT REQUIRE GROUND TRUTH DATA

The following numbers in the report require actual ground truth reference transcripts to verify:

### Full System Performance
- Full system WER (currently estimated as 8.0-9.0%)
- Full system CER (currently estimated as 1.8-2.0%)
- Error detection precision/recall
- Correction success rates

### Ablation Study Results
- Component-specific WER contributions
- Configuration-specific performance metrics

### Statistical Analysis
- Paired t-test p-values
- Cohen's d effect sizes
- Confidence intervals

### Why These Need Ground Truth:
- Current evaluation uses baseline transcription as reference (WER = 0%)
- Need actual human-verified transcripts to measure real improvements
- Error detection and correction metrics require known errors

---

## 🔧 HOW TO VERIFY REMAINING NUMBERS

### Option 1: Use Existing Ground Truth Dataset
```python
# If you have a dataset with ground truth transcripts:
from src.integration import UnifiedSTTSystem

system = UnifiedSTTSystem()
results = system.evaluate_batch(
    audio_files=["audio1.wav", "audio2.wav"],
    reference_transcripts=["ground truth 1", "ground truth 2"]
)
```

### Option 2: Create Synthetic Test Cases
```python
# Create test cases with known errors:
# 1. Transcribe audio with baseline
# 2. Introduce known errors
# 3. Use as reference
# 4. Measure correction effectiveness
```

### Option 3: Use Public STT Datasets
- LibriSpeech
- Common Voice
- TIMIT
- Any dataset with ground truth transcripts
